# binary-vs-decimal-prefixes
Binary prefixes are always larger than their decimal equivalents, for example 1024 > 1000 (kibibyte, kilobyte). A simulation to find out when it happens that the binary prefix is _x_ times greater than decimal.

## Results
It appears that binary 2^2920 is 1000 times larger than decimal 10^876, as though 1 kibibyte were as big as 1 megabyte.
